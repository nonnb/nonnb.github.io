# Clone

Use the **Repository \| Clone** option to create a clone of an existing Git repository.

Specify the repository to clone by providing a remote URL, for example:
- `ssh://user@server:port/path` if using SSH
- `https://user@server:port/path` if using HTTPS
- or, if the repository is locally available on your file system, by specifying the file path.

In the **Selection** step, you can configure whether submodules of the repository should also be cloned; usually, this option should be selected as submodules are an integral part of the main repository you are cloning. 

**Include Submodules** should be deselected only when you do not need to clone specific submodules. For more details, refer to the [Submodules documentation](../../GitConcepts/Submodules.md).

Usually, you will want to fetch the entire commit history of the repository, including all branches (heads) and tags. However, on very large repositories, if you are only interested in a specific branch (head) or tag, deselect **Fetch all Heads and Tags**. This allows you to control which branch to fetch, and optionally choose not to **Fetch all commits** but instead **Fetch Only the Latest x commits**, which will allow a shallow clone to a depth of **x** commits.

**Note**

- Some Git commands do not work correctly with partial repositories (e.g., Pull with Rebase), and tools such as GitVersion may not work correctly with partial clones.

In the subsequent steps, you must provide the path to the local directory where the clone should be created and configure a few options.

If your server supports [partial clones](https://git-scm.com/docs/partial-clone), you can select **Skip large files** to specify the maximum file size of binary files (blobs) to be fetched during the initial clone (see below).

# Partial Clones

Partial Clones are an effective way to reduce the amount of space required by your clone and the time needed to perform the clone. They are especially helpful if your repository contains large (binary) files that are not of interest. 

**Note**

- Partial Clones provide an optimization to reduce the size of local clones and by definition will not clone the entire repository to the local file system. SmartGit will require a connection to the remote repository when any operation is attempted relating to the omitted files.
- Not all Git servers support partial clones. If you try to **Skip large files** on a server that does not support partial clones, SmartGit will report an error.

Once the clone has finished, SmartGit will fetch all required blobs (regardless of size) to perform subsequent Git operations on this clone. For example, letâ€™s assume that your repository contains a large file named large:

- The initial clone (git clone) will not fetch any blobs related to large.
- Immediately after the clone, SmartGit will scan the working tree (git status) and fetch the blob representing large in the `HEAD` commit.
- When selecting a different commit in the Log **Graph** where large has changed, SmartGit will fetch the two blobs representing `large` before and after the change.
- When invoking a **File Log** on `large`, SmartGit will fetch *all* blobs related to `large`.
