**TODO**
- Change the name of this article (SmartGit GUI?)
- Welcome to SmartGit
- User has just launched SmartGit

- Give the user an overview of the [Main Windows](Main-Windows.md)
- Standardize naming
-- Window - reserved for the 3 main screens in SmartGit (Working Tree, Log, Standard)
-- Perspective? Where 'sub window' screens exist, e.g. Standard View has Local Files + History
-- Views - These are the widgets embedded within Windows e.g. Repositories, Branches, FIles, Changes, Commit, Log View etc
-- The Ribbon Bar? Don't think we can call it this - i.e. where the big buttons are
-- Banner - i.e. where messages such as merge conflict and other Working Tree states show up
-- Icons above the 'Views' specific to the view, e.g. the small icons on the Files menu, File Filter inputs etc
-- Right Mouse Click menus - is it right mouse click on all OS versions?

- Allow user to customize [User Preferences](Preferences/Preferences.md)

- [Local Operations on the Working Tree](Local-Operations-on-the-Working-Tree.md)
